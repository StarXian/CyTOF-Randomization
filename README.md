# CyTOF-Randomization
R code used in paper "Challenges in the multivariate analysis of mass cytometry data: the effect of randomization."

* [Dimensionality Reduction and Phenotyping](https://github.com/giopap/CyTOF-Randomization/tree/master/dimensionality%20reduction%20and%20phenotyping) : this folder contains code for reproducing the results shown in Figures 2 and 4 that is, on Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, JIVE, MDS, tSNE) and Cell phenotyping (ensemble clustering)

* [Network Reconstruction](https://github.com/giopap/CyTOF-Randomization/tree/master/network%20analysis) : this file contains code for reproducing the results shown in Figure 5 and table 1 on network reconstruction analysis (gLASSO, rFCI, RNs)

* For Figure 3 (SPADE results) we used the matlab application of deterministic SPADE (with default parameters, see text) which can be found here: http://pengqiu.gatech.edu/software/SPADE/
