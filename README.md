# CyTOF-Randomization
Code for reproducing results for the paper "Challenges in the multivariate analysis of mass cytometry data: the effect of randomization."

These code files can be used the results shown in Figures 2, 4 and 5. For Figure 3 (SPADE) we used the matlab application of deterministic SPADE (with default parameters) which can be found here: http://pengqiu.gatech.edu/software/SPADE/
